SDL Rogue - Roadmap

======================
Already accomplished:
======================

+ Tile rendering
+ Player rendering
+ Player movement (+ smooth movement)
+ Player collision
+ Camera implementation (+ border limiting)
+ Teleports (= visible or non-visible staircases)
+ Upper layer (purely aesthetic drawing layer on top of player )
+ Performance increase + FPS Limiting
+ Doors
+ Popup Menu allowing player to "open door" and "unlock door"
+ Keys (with which locked doors can be opened)

+ Closed door images and functionality (basics)
+ Add stats to the player, render them in the sidebar
  - Name
  - HP & MP
  - STR, INT, DEX, CON, CHA, LUC
  - Keys
  - Money

+ Have the following load from a file:

	> Specific objects (object[#][#]) 	- Level file
	> The level (all the rooms)		- Level file
	> Which tiles are collidable		- Tileset config file
	> Performance Optimization vars		- Config file
	> Monsters				- Monster DB file
	> AI Attacks				- Attack DB file

======================
Next few tasks:
======================

Adding Combat. This will require me to know a few things.

++ Which variables will the 'monster' need to have in it's object
&& Which variables can be referred to by prototype

++ Which other variables need to be known by the rest of the combat procedure
> Endurance for the procedure
> Moves & Spells (+mana costs)
> Current Mana

++ Combat procedure structure
> Rendering, placing the HUD
> Counting up the endurance counters, waiting for a response
1> On Player response draw the HUD, providing choice between moves & spells
1> Player selects a move (+spell) and the game checks if it's possible
2> On CPU response, select an attack and check if it's possible
> If it is, the action is added to a que, step by step
> The que is completed, 1 action at a time, and rendered all the way
> Stats are modified accordingly, effects applied etc.
> Repeat until one side is dead

======================
To be accomplished:
======================

+ Add Combat (with basic hardcoded weapon)

+ Prevent program errors from incorrect file content. 'Tighten' everything.

+ Add Carryable weapons (replacing the hardcoded one) +LFF
+ Add Spells +LFF

+ Add Level up functionality (meaning, stats change dynamically as you level up)

+ Add carryable items +LFF
+ Add 'treasure chests'
+ Add item usability

+ Create conversation system

+ Create a Main Menu which functions as a "home" inside the program
+ Add Save/Load functionality
+ Add ingame Config editting for major functions

+ Create "Random Level" routine to make it a "true" Roguelike game.
+ Create a sepperate level editor to create roomsets etc.
